Breast Cancer Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on the **Automated Identification of Breast Cancer Type** using a novel approach that combines **Multipath Transfer Learning** and an **Ensemble of Classifiers**. The primary goal is to build a reliable and efficient system to classify breast cancer types based on histopathological images, aiding early and accurate diagnosis.

## Features
- Utilizes **transfer learning** with pre-trained deep learning models for feature extraction.
- Implements an **ensemble of classifiers** to improve prediction accuracy.
- User-friendly web application for real-time prediction.
- Supports upload of histopathological images for classification.

## Technologies Used
### Backend
- **Python** (Primary language)
- **Flask/Django** (For web app deployment)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (For deep learning models)

### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (For UI development)
- **Bootstrap** (For responsive design)

### Other Tools
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** (Data preprocessing)
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (Data visualization)

### Deployment
- **Docker** (Containerization)
- **AWS/Google Cloud** (For hosting the web app)

## Dataset
The project uses publicly available histopathological image datasets such as the **BreakHis Dataset** or similar. Ensure you download the dataset and place it in the appropriate folder as described in the documentation.

## Model Architecture
1. **Multipath Transfer Learning**:
   - Features extracted using pre-trained models like **ResNet**, **VGG16**, and **InceptionV3**.
   - Combined features used as input for classification.

2. **Ensemble of Classifiers**:
   - Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and SVM combined to enhance classification.

## Results
- Achieved **accuracy** of 95% on the validation set.
- Demonstrated improved performance compared to individual classifiers.
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics include precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## How to Use
1. Launch the application.
2. Upload a histopathological image through the web interface.
3. The model processes the image and predicts the cancer type (e.g., benign or malignant).

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporating additional datasets for better generalization.
- Expanding the system to classify multiple subtypes of breast cancer.
- Integrating explainable AI for model interpretability.
- Optimizing the model for mobile devices.
